## Final Step

### Share Your Holiday Cheer

You did it! You created a charming Christmas card and now...and now what? How do you share your card with friends and family? What good is a Christmas card if you can't send it to anyone??

Don't worry! This file has you covered. In the final stage of this activity, we will use a free hosting service to turn our files into a website.

There are a number of websites that offer free hosting. In this example, we're going to use [x10hosting](https://x10hosting.com). They offer free hosting with zero ads (hooray!). Their website is a bit slow, so now is the ideal time to grab a drink so you have something to sip while waiting on each request to finish.

First, go create an account at [x10hosting](https://x10hosting.com).
Their website does a decent job of walking you through the steps of verifying your email address and choosing a domain name for your website.

Once you have completed creating an account, click on the action item titled `Add Website`.

Within the `Add Website` form, use the `Custom Website` option and fill out the field `Website Name`. You can skip the `domain` field as this should already be populated with the domain name you chose earlier. Leave the `Address Path` empty. Click on `Add Website` to progress to the next step.

After submitting the form, you should see a message similar to "Website successfully created". Click on `Continue to My Websites`.

Select `File Manager`.

This should bring you to a page that looks rather similar the File Manager on your computer. On this page, in the top nav bar, select `Upload`.

Select `Choose File`.

Upload your `christmas_card.html` file and your `style.css` file. This may take some time but once it's done, the progress bar will show the word "completed" or something similiar to indicate the files have been successfully uploaded.

Once the files are uploaded, test your site to see if it works! Visit the domain that was created for you, it should be `<the_domain_name_you_chose.x10host.com`.

Did it work? Did you do a little dance when you saw it? Now, it's time for the really fun part! Go share your Christmas card with everyone you know! Brag about how you created a Christmas Card with code and deployed it to a website, just for them!

# Center the Christmas Card
Let's move our Christmas card to the center of the webpage and slightly darken the
background of our page.

To center the Christmas card, we'll use the `margin` property.
```
section {
  background: url(https://codecademy-content.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/web-beginner-en-9xjis/images/winter.jpg);
  width: 700px;
  height: 500px;
  color: white;
  margin: auto;
}
```
# Darken the Background
To darken the page around the christmas card, we'll use the `body` tag to set a background color.
At the top of your `style.css` file, add the following:
```
body {
  background: Snow;
}
```
The change is background color is very subtle. If you would like to play around
with additional colors, I recommend visiting [147 Colors](http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/).

# Add a Holiday Greeting
Let's add a greeting to our card by using the `<h1>` tag.

In the `christmas_card.html` file, between the body tags, add:
```
<h1>Your holiday greeting</h1>
```

Below the newly added `<h1>` tag, use an `<h2>` tag to tell the recipient who the card is from:
```
<h2>From: your name</h2>
```
